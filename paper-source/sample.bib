abstract="Compressive sensing is a new type of sampling theory, which predicts that sparse signals and images can be reconstructed from what was previously believed to be incomplete information. As a main feature, efficient algorithms such as ℓ1-minimization can be used for recovery. The theory has many potential applications in signal processing and imaging. This chapter gives an introduction and overview on both theoretical and numerical aspects of compressive sensing.",
